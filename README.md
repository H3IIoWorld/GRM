In light of the constructive feedback received during the AAAI 2026 review process, we have resolved to further refine our work and expand the scope of our publication. Upon completion of subsequent submissions, the source code will be made fully available here, with access anticipated to commence after April 2026.

In view of the page limit for submissions to AAAI 2026, we shall upload a more complete version of the paper (including the appendix content) to arXiv (under review).
